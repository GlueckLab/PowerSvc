Power Service 2.0.2 Release Notes
--------------------------------------------

Bug Fixes

- infinite loop on some inputs

Enhancements

- call JavaStatistics library asynchronously to support timeouts
- log all input studies
- capture and log errors

Known Issues

- Extremely large sample sizes (> 100K) may lead to numerical
overflows and yield lower than expected power values, or
may fail due to invalid degrees of freedom in the underlying
F approximations

- The Java virtual machine (JVM) has run out of memory itself on
at least one occasion and the process exited.  Do not know if
it's a problem with Java itself, resource leakage or if certain
input can cause the condition.
