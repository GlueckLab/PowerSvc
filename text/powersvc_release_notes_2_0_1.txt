Power Service 2.0.1 Release Notes
--------------------------------------------

Bug Fixes

- matrix html now produces MathJax instead of MathML to support
a greater variety of browsers.  Note that many browsers have dropped
native support of MathML.

Known Issues

- Extremely large sample sizes (> 100K) may lead to numerical
overflows and yield lower than expected power values, or
may fail due to invalid degrees of freedom in the underlying
F approximations
