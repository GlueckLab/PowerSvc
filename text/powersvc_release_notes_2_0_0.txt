Power Service 2.0.0 Release Notes
--------------------------------------------

Features

- Rewrite of communication layer to use StudyDesign object model
(see the WebServiceCommon layer for details)
- Adds the ability to obtain the matrices from a study design
either as JSON or MathML/HTML
- Accepts designs with no between participant factors

API Changes

- The external API has changed to use JSON instead of XML
- All calls expect a StudyDesign object (see WebServiceCommon)

Dependency Changes

- Upgraded to Apache Commons Math version 3.0.
- Integrated JavaStatistics library 1.2.0.

Bug Fixes

- For GUIDED study designs, now adjusts sigmaG and sigmaYG
to be covariance matrices (these are specified as standard
deviations and correlations for guided designs)

Known Issues

- Extremely large sample sizes (> 100K) may lead to numerical
overflows and yield lower than expected power values, or
may fail due to invalid degrees of freedom in the underlying
F approximations
